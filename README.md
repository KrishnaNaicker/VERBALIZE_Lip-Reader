VERBALIZE Lip-Reader
A deep learning model based on TensorFlow used for lip reading.

Overview
This project focuses on creating a deep learning model that can interpret and understand lip movements to predict spoken words. The model is implemented using TensorFlow and is designed to enhance speech recognition systems by incorporating visual cues from lip movements.

Features
Deep Learning Model: Utilizes TensorFlow for building and training the lip-reading model.
Jupyter Notebook: Contains the backend implementation in a Jupyter Notebook.
High Accuracy: Aims to improve the accuracy of speech recognition by combining visual and audio data.
